Promt: In the ci.yml file ,generate a workflow with the following requirements: ○ Trigger: Trigger an action on a push or pull request to a branch containing develop or master in its name. ○ Job: Create one Job (for example, cross_build). 
○ Strategy: Use a matrix (strategy: matrix) to run the build on three operating systems: ■ runs-on: ubuntu-latest (Linux) ■ runs-on: windows-latest (Windows) ■ runs-on: macos-latest (macOS) ○ Steps: Each build must include the following steps: 
■ Code checkout (actions/checkout@v4). ■ CMake installation (if necessary). ■ Run configuration and build commands (run the script from Step 3). ■ Deploy.
Copilot:
```yaml name=.github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - '*develop*'
      - '*master*'
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - '*develop*'
      - '*master*'

jobs:
  cross_build:
    name: Cross-platform build
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup CMake
        # cross-platform CMake setup; adjust cmake-version if you need a specific release
        uses: kitware/setup-cmake@v2
        with:
          cmake-version: '3.26.4'

      - name: Configure (CMake)
        run: |
          cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

      - name: Build
        run: |
          cmake --build build --config Release --parallel

      - name: Deploy / Upload artifact
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: build-${{ matrix.os }}
          path: build
```

What I prepared: a single workflow file (.github/workflows/ci.yml) that triggers on push or pull_request to any branch whose name contains develop or master, runs a matrix job across Linux (ubuntu-latest), Windows (windows-latest) and macOS (macos-latest), and performs checkout, CMake setup, configure & build, and an artifact upload as the deploy step.

Next steps you can take:
- Copy this file into your repository at .github/workflows/ci.yml on the branch you want (or create a PR) to enable the workflow.
- If you want a different CMake version, change the cmake-version value.
- If "Deploy" should do something else (publish to a release, push to package registry, run tests, or run a custom deployment script), tell me what target/deploy mechanism you prefer and I’ll modify the workflow accordingly.
